### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Will and I am a passionate developer. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently for ADP as a software developer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool or interesting projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to grow and expand my knowledge as a developer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I was in a Pampers advert as a baby. 

Outside of programming I'm a tennis player, love the outdoors, and I am a keen photographer and traveller.
